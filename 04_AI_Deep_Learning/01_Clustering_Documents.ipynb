After years of residing in my home, I applied for a home equity line of credit on two occasions, first on XX/XX/ and again on XX/XX/. During the XX/XX/ application process, I briefly worked with   (  ID :  ; at the   location in , AL ). After   reviewed my credit, my credit score was  ; however, there was incorrect student loan payments listed on the paperwork she reviewed. Therefore, the next day, I attached the correct student loan payments in an email to   and left several voice messages to follow up with me. I never received any follow-up calls nor emails from  . On XX/XX/, I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that my application had been denied due to \" Income insufficient for existing debt \\'\\'. The results could have been different if   would have submitted the correct payments instead of giving up on my application because of the initial results. \\nOn XX/XX/, I decided to try the process again at another Wells Fargo Branch and this time worked with   (  ID :  ; at the   location in , AL ).   was outstanding at obtaining the correct paperwork from me to correct the student loan payments that were initially incorrect during the first application process. I provided documentation of correct monthly payments, which significantly decreased my debt to income ratio. Any information and documentation that was requested from me, was promptly given to Wells Fargo. Once I supplied   with the correct paperwork, the problem started with the underwriting team. \\nAfter a few days, I was assigned a Home Equity Specialist,   (  ID : #  ).   \\'s initial contact with me was on XX/XX/ via voice message. At the time of his call, I was in a work conference ; however, I returned his call within that same hour. In spite of this,   called my banker and threatened to take my application away because I refused to get in contact with him, which was not true. However, I called him numerous of times after his call and even left  voice messages. After several attempts, I called the number back and asked to speak with any specialist that could assist me. I was connected with a   (  #  ) who was of great assistance and answered any questions that I asked of her.  and I discussed possible dates that different steps of the process may be completed and those dates were documented on \" yourLoanTracker \\'\\'. After a few days,   deleted those dates. \\n  and I actually communicated via phone on . During this conversation, I asked   questions about property rights and   told me that he would find out more information for me and will get back with me. Instead, I was informed that   canceled my application, documenting that I was going through a divorce. I never advised him to close my application ; he was only supposed to be finding the answers to the questions that I asked of him regarding rights to my property. After this situation was brought to management \\'s attention, they denied my application citing that during the `` drive by appraisal \\'\\', my home was not worth anything and that I did not have enough equity to pull from the home, which is definitely not true. I was told that I could fight this and get another appraisal ; however, after all that I had gone through with Wells Fargo, I decided it was not worth any additional efforts with this company. \\nI have written to their Home Equity compliant address ; however, I have not received any response from Wells Fargo. \\n', \"I tried to get a refund on {$4500.00} worth of cards.

They treated me like dirt when I was robbed a few yrs ago & wanted a HELOC loan as I was robbed of all my money, ID, etc. In any event, they lent me $  at 29.99 % with the understanding that THEY would deduct the monthly payment from my WF checking. Before I got that  loan, they hit my credit reports  hard inquiries in 3 wks. I complained to the CEO \\'s office & had to deal with the CEO complaint dept in AZ. They were ok, but did nothing to really help. I just figured I \\'d let it go after I got removed all but  of their HARD inquiries. Everyone knows a hard inquiry goes against your credit by about  pts apiece ( they tell you  pts ). OK, other problems with their ethics or lack thereof, but I recently sold a property & decided I was going to pay down ALL my open credit accts., WF who was \" supposed \\'\\' to take the money out of my checking for the payment ( their own bank checking ), on purpose my guess, took it out 1-2 days early. I do n\\'t keep much in checking there ( at least {$5.00} because they took over my local bank that went bankrupt and was no charge but WF decided to charge {$5.00} if you keep less than average of {$1500.00} ). I am a senior citizen so I choose not to put any in WF but minimal. Several times, WF took payment early ( even though they knew I deposited a check from another bank & it was there & visible to me ), but they said money was not there so the \" PAID \\'\\' to the personal line of credit. In paying to that personal line of credit, they charged me an OVERDRAFT fee each time of {$35.00} even though the money had been put in their bank ( they also HOLD CASH from  inside WF acct to another JUST TO GET ANOTHER DAY OF INTEREST ). OK, I paid {$1200.00} from my WF checking on the , done online instant transfer to the loan account ( it showed PENDING for 3 days ...    does not do that ). I then decided to put  in my WF checking to pay another $  on that loan. So, I paid {$3200.00} on that loan knowing they put another HOLD or PENDING on the money transferred from their own acct. I just went in to transfer {$500.00} from my WF checking to that same WF loan. It says of course ... PENDING ( it \\'s cash for goodness sake! & their cash ). OK, I happened to look & noticed the change & I have not been notified by them, but I noticed it said all of the entire loan had {$390.00} available. Well when you pay as much as I have in 2 wks, I knew that was wrong. I looked & GOOD OLE WF BANK had lowered the amt of the loan from  to  ( of course with full intent in my opinion of destroying my credit ). I had  bank do that a couple of yrs ago. So unethical. HOWEVER, at the time of this complaint, they have not bothered to tell me they have done this. I just happened to see that the amount of loan is $  & amount available is {$390.00} They are scum! I decided I am going to go into WF Bank on Mon. & pay the remainder in cash & close the acct. They are an unethical bank, will do anything to take a random $  in fees, PLUS they have a borrowing fee of no less than $  on this loan acct.
